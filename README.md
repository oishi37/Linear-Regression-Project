## What are the effects on GDP based on social factors? 
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and using linear regression I tried to explain the effects of social factors and based on how significant each predictor is, I built a model to predict GDP. Preceding the model construction, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted, ensuring adherence to linear modeling assumptions. Statistical techniques were applied to rectify and enhance the dataset, while meticulous attention was given to identifying model violations, performing diagnostics, and acknowledging limitations.
